In Node.js, the File module usually means the fs (File System) module. It lets you read, write, update, delete, and watch files on your system.


Here are **short, exam-ready notes** on the **File Module (`fs`) in Node.js** 📘

## File Module in Node.js (`fs`)

### Definition

The **File System (fs) module** in Node.js is used to **work with files and directories** such as reading, writing, updating, deleting, and watching files.

---

## Importing the `fs` Module

### CommonJS

```js
const fs = require("fs");
```

### ES Module

```js
import fs from "fs";
import fsPromises from "fs/promises";
```

---

## Types of File Operations

### 1. Asynchronous (Non-Blocking) ✅

* Uses callbacks or promises
* Does not block execution

```js
fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf8", callback);
```

### 2. Synchronous (Blocking) ❌

* Blocks execution until completed

```js
fs.readFileSync("file.txt", "utf8");
```

---

## Common File Operations

### Read File

```js
fs.readFile("a.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {});
```

### Write File (Overwrite)

```js
fs.writeFile("a.txt", "Hello", callback);
```

### Append File

```js
fs.appendFile("a.txt", "World", callback);
```

### Delete File

```js
fs.unlink("a.txt", callback);
```

---

## Directory Operations

### Create Folder

```js
fs.mkdir("folder", callback);
```

### Read Folder

```js
fs.readdir("folder", callback);
```

### Delete Folder

```js
fs.rmdir("folder", callback);
```

---

## Checking File Existence

```js
fs.existsSync("a.txt");
```

---

## File Streams

Used for handling **large files** efficiently.

```js
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("input.txt");
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt");
readStream.pipe(writeStream);
```

---

## `fs` vs `fs/promises`

| fs             | fs/promises              |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| Callback based | Promise based            |
| Older approach | Modern approach          |
| Harder to read | Cleaner with async/await |

---

## Advantages

* Built-in Node.js module
* Efficient file handling
* Supports async operations
* Works with streams

---

## Disadvantages

* Sync methods block execution
* Error handling needed

---

## Use Cases

* File upload/download
* Logging
* Reading configuration files
* Data storage

---

## Conclusion

The **`fs` module** is essential in Node.js for **file and directory management** and is best used with **asynchronous methods**.
