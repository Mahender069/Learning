Love this request — this is exactly how you *lock it in*.
Here are **clean, structured notes covering every concept we talked about**, from zero → full GraphQL mental model.

You can treat this like **final revision notes**.

# 🧠 GRAPHQL + APOLLO — COMPLETE NOTES

---

## 1️⃣ What is an API?

* An **API** lets one program talk to another
* Frontend → requests data
* Backend → sends data

---

## 2️⃣ RESTful API

### What it is

* A way to design APIs using:

  * URLs (endpoints)
  * HTTP methods

### Example

```http
GET /users
GET /users/1
POST /users
```

### Problems

* **Overfetching** → getting extra data
* **Underfetching** → needing multiple requests

---

## 3️⃣ What is GraphQL?

### Definition

* GraphQL is a **query language for APIs**
* Lets the **client ask for exactly the data it wants**

### Key benefits

* No overfetching
* No underfetching
* One request for complex data
* Client controls response shape

---

## 4️⃣ GraphQL vs REST (core idea)

| REST                | GraphQL             |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Many endpoints      | One endpoint        |
| Server decides data | Client decides data |
| Often extra data    | Exact data only     |

---

## 5️⃣ What is a GraphQL Server?

A GraphQL server:

* Accepts GraphQL queries
* Validates them using schema
* Runs resolvers
* Returns response

---

## 6️⃣ Apollo Server

* A **popular GraphQL server implementation**
* Runs GraphQL APIs
* Handles:

  * schema
  * resolvers
  * execution

⚠️ Apollo Server is **not the only one**

---

## 7️⃣ Types of GraphQL Servers

### Custom servers

* Apollo Server
* GraphQL Yoga
* Mercurius
* GraphQL.js

### Auto-generated APIs

* Hasura
* AWS AppSync

---

## 8️⃣ What is a Schema?

### Definition

* **Blueprint / contract** of the GraphQL API
* Defines:

  * what data exists
  * what queries/mutations are allowed
  * relationships

⚠️ Schema ≠ database structure

---

## 9️⃣ Schema Syntax (SDL)

### Object types

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String
}
```

### Query

```graphql
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
  users: [User!]!
}
```

### Mutation

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createUser(name: String!): User
}
```

---

## 🔟 Scalars

Built-in types:

```graphql
String
Int
Float
Boolean
ID
```

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Nullability & Lists

```graphql
User        # nullable
User!       # required
[User]      # list
[User!]!    # required list of required users
```

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ What is a Query?

* Queries are **read operations**
* Defined in the schema
* Look like function signatures

Schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}
```

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Writing Queries (Client Side)

### Simple query

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

### Query with arguments

```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    name
  }
}
```

### Query with variables

```graphql
query GetUser($id: ID!) {
  user(id: $id) {
    name
  }
}
```

Variables:

```json
{ "id": 1 }
```

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ What is a Resolver?

### Definition

* A **function that runs when a field is requested**
* Provides the actual data

> Schema defines **what**
> Resolver defines **how**

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Resolver Structure

```js
(parent, args, context, info)
```

Common usage:

* `args` → query arguments
* `context` → db, auth
* `parent` → data from previous resolver

---

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Resolver for Query with Arguments

Schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}
```

Resolver:

```js
Query: {
  user: (_, { id }, { db }) => {
    return db.user.findById(id);
  }
}
```

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ What is `_` (underscore)?

* `_` means **parameter exists but is unused**
* Common JS convention

```js
(_, args) => {}
```

Means:

```js
(parent, args)
```

but parent is ignored.

---

## 1️⃣8️⃣ What is `parent`?

### Definition

* `parent` is the **result returned by the resolver above**

### Used in nested fields

Example:

```graphql
user {
  posts {
    title
  }
}
```

Resolvers:

```js
User: {
  posts: (parent) => getPosts(parent.id)
}
```

---

## 1️⃣9️⃣ Resolver Flow (Very Important)

1. Query runs
2. Top-level resolver runs
3. Result becomes `parent`
4. Nested resolvers run
5. Response is shaped

---

## 2️⃣0️⃣ What is a Mutation?

### Definition

* Used to **change data**
* Create / update / delete

| Operation | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| Query     | Read    |
| Mutation  | Write   |

---

## 2️⃣1️⃣ Mutation Example

Schema:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  updateProduct(id: ID!, name: String): Product
}
```

Client:

```graphql
mutation {
  updateProduct(id: 1, name: "New") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

Resolver:

```js
Mutation: {
  updateProduct: (_, args) => { ... }
}
```

---

## 2️⃣2️⃣ Input Types (Best Practice)

```graphql
input UpdateProductInput {
  name: String
  price: Int
}

type Mutation {
  updateProduct(id: ID!, input: UpdateProductInput!): Product
}
```

---

## 2️⃣3️⃣ JavaScript `...` (VERY IMPORTANT)

### Rest operator (collect)

```js
(_, { id, ...updates })
```

Means:

```js
updates = { all other fields except id }
```

---

### Spread operator (copy & overwrite)

```js
{
  ...oldObject,
  ...newValues
}
```

* Copies old object
* Overwrites fields with new ones

---

## 2️⃣4️⃣ Update Pattern Explained

```js
const updatedProduct = {
  ...products[index],
  ...updates
};
```

Meaning:

> Take old product → apply only updated fields

---

## 2️⃣5️⃣ Full Mental Model (FINAL)

```
Client Query
   ↓
Schema validation
   ↓
Resolvers execute
   ↓
Database / logic
   ↓
GraphQL shapes response
   ↓
Client gets exact data requested
```

---

## 🧠 ONE-SCREEN SUMMARY

* GraphQL avoids overfetching
* Apollo Server runs GraphQL
* Schema = API blueprint
* Query = read
* Mutation = write
* Resolver = logic
* Args = inputs
* Parent = previous result
* `...` = collect / overwrite
* Client controls response shape
