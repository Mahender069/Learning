so every react object must have some properties
    $$typeof:Symbol('react-element'),
    type:'h1',
    ref:null,
    props:{}

so react element is a simple object which as properties



type property isn't limited to html tags it can be also a function and this function is called by the render function (if the type is string(html tag) then the render will a create a tag of that type and add its attributes from props)
    and if the function has arugments its properties of props
     so so a react compoenet is a react element whose type is a function and its arugments are in props
        root.render({
            $$typeof:Symbol.for('react.transitional.element'),
            type:Fun,
            ref:null,
            props:{
                name:'Mahender',
                age:21
            }
        });


React component is a function which returns a jsx and compoenet is a reusable piece of UI 
    and one convenient is function name must Start with Captial

        function FunctionName(props){
            const {}=props;
        }
        <FunctionName props />
