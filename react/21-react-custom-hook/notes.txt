A custom hook is just your own Hook that you create to reuse logic.

👉 Think of it like a recipe 🍪
Instead of cooking the same thing again and again, you write the recipe once and reuse it.

❓ Why do we use Custom Hooks?

We use custom hooks to:

✔️ Reuse logic (state + effects)
✔️ Avoid copy-paste code
✔️ Keep components clean & readable
✔️ Separate logic from UI

⚠️ Rules of Custom Hooks ❗

Can call other hooks

No JSX inside custom hooks

Use them only in components or other hooks

👉 Custom hooks let you reuse React logic across components in a clean way.
