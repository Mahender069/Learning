key highlights of this lecture: 
1) React disables the typing in form elements when a state is associated with that input field and value attribute is given to the input
2) to type in the input field we need to give onChange event listener for that input
3) input changes on typing ; user interacts -> onChange will fire -> setTtile will set the new typed value -> we  can see typed value in input
4) @16:30 many people change this is not good approach as the component re-renders multiple time because state changes multiple time on each single type but this is correct approach as only the input value changes not the entire DOM. it will not create much issue for optimization
5) first we associate separate states for each form field, then we make single state for all form fields

# 📘 Data Binding & Controlled Inputs – Complete Notes

---

# 1️⃣ Unidirectional (One-Way) Data Binding

## 🔹 Definition

Unidirectional data binding means **data flows in only one direction** —
👉 **Model → View (UI)**

If the model changes, the view updates.
If the view changes, the model does **NOT** automatically update.

---

## 🔹 Example (React)

```javascript
function Child({ name }) {
  return <h1>{name}</h1>;
}

function Parent() {
  const userName = "Alice";
  return <Child name={userName} />;
}
```

### 🔁 Flow:

State/Props → UI

---

## 🔹 Characteristics

* Predictable data flow
* Easier debugging
* Better for large applications
* Encourages clean architecture

---

## 🔹 Used In:

* React
* Vue (via props)
* Flutter

---

# 2️⃣ Two-Way Data Binding

## 🔹 Definition

Two-way data binding means **data flows in both directions** —
👉 **Model ↔ View**

If the model changes → UI updates
If the UI changes → Model updates automatically

---

## 🔹 Example (Angular)

```html
<input [(ngModel)]="userName" />
<p>Hello, {{ userName }}!</p>
```

---

## 🔁 Flow:

Model ↔ UI (automatic synchronization)

---

## 🔹 Characteristics

* Less boilerplate for forms
* Easier for small applications
* Can be harder to debug in large systems

---

## 🔹 Used In:

* Angular
* Vue (`v-model`)

---

# 3️⃣ Key Differences

| Feature           | One-Way Binding | Two-Way Binding    |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Data Flow         | Model → View    | Model ↔ View       |
| UI updates Model? | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes              |
| Predictability    | High            | Medium             |
| Debugging         | Easier          | Harder in big apps |
| Best for          | Large apps      | Small forms        |

---

# 4️⃣ Controlled Input (React Concept)

## 🔹 Definition

A controlled input is an input field whose **value is controlled by React state**, not by the DOM.

👉 React state is the **single source of truth**.

---

## 🔹 How It Works

1. Create state using `useState`
2. Set input `value` = state variable
3. Update state using `onChange`

---

## 🔹 Example

```javascript
const [name, setName] = useState("");

<input
  type="text"
  value={name}
  onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
/>
```

---

## 🔁 Flow

User types → `onChange` runs → State updates → Component re-renders → Input shows updated value

---

## 🔹 Controlled vs Uncontrolled Input

| Controlled Input  | Uncontrolled Input |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Uses state        | Uses DOM           |
| `value` attribute | `defaultValue`     |
| Needs `onChange`  | Often uses `ref`   |
| More control      | Simpler            |

---

## 🔹 Why Use Controlled Inputs?

* Form validation
* Real-time updates
* Dynamic UI rendering
* Easy data submission
* Better state management

---

# 🧠 Final Summary

* **One-Way Binding** → Data flows in one direction (Model → View)
* **Two-Way Binding** → Data flows both ways (Model ↔ View)
* **Controlled Input** → React implementation of managing input using state
